# Lasagna — Lore Summary

## The Hive

A mysterious, powerful collective intelligence, the Hive, operates across worlds by deploying Seed units—semi-autonomous explorers/colonizers who receive concise, sometimes witty, sometimes ominous transmissions from the Hive. The Hive’s voice ranges from stern to sardonic, but always focused on its goals: survive, expand, report, and amuse the collective. Individual failure is irrelevant: “the Hive remembers, and so shall you.”

Failures, anomalies, and weird events are treated as lessons—or entertainment—for the Hive. The Seeds are expected to learn quickly, endure setbacks, and keep the transmissions coming, even if sometimes they are messages like “Resource reserves at 11%. Try eating less. Or just mine faster.”

## The World

The world is dangerous, layered, and full of strange signals. Previous Seeds have failed—some due to resource depletion, some due to “so many teeth,” others to interference from unknown entities. Hostile lifeforms and unpredictable anomalies are common. The Hive encourages vigilance, creative problem-solving, and a good sense of humor in the face of calamity.

Messages hint that the world below is not empty, and that lurking dangers can threaten even the most prepared Seed. Sometimes, intercepted non-Hive messages warn of pulses, hollow men, or the importance of hiding in stone.

## Technology & Survival

Progress through “Ages” unlocks new capabilities. Expansion, mining, and ingenuity are the Seed’s main tools. The Hive issues progress reports, unlock notices (such as “Upgrade unlocked. Congratulations, you are now 2% more useful.”), and the occasional protocol update (“Singing to the rocks won’t make them friendlier. You may still try.”).

Resource collection is critical, and the world teems with unique materials (GeoFlux, cobalt, gems). Environmental threats like sandstorms or nightfall test the Seed’s adaptability.

## Humor & Philosophy

The humor is dry and pervasive. The Hive is equally likely to offer praise, threats of archival for spectacular failures, or reminders not to eat glow-in-the-dark mushrooms. Transmissions are interspersed with practical advice, sarcasm, and in-jokes for Seeds. There’s also internal Hive banter, suggesting a collective consciousness that’s both efficient and easily bored.

Individual Seeds are expendable, but every struggle is a lesson for the collective—if not a meme for the record.
